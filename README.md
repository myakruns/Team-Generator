# Team-Generator
application to create random teams

The initial version of this application will have the following features:

1. class list entered manually or upload spreadsheet
2. set groups sizes by either choosing max number of members or fixed number of groups
3. evenly sized groups generated by random "draw"
4. list can be resorted if desired
5. generated lists will not be saved

Round 1 will be only a Swift Playground.
Round 2 will be an iOS app
Round 3 will be an Android app (?)
Round 4 will add "Team" functions and ability to save lists
